## Submission Instructions

### Overview
 My capstone project is going to be an application that keeps tracks of household items, todo's, scheduled maintenance, etc...
It will allow a user to input notes, dates, photos to keep track of things they've done or need to do.
For example replaced the furnace filter on a certain date and record the UPC or model number and size for reference later.
It will be a central place for notes, reminders, a place to
keep records of things that may require a time stamp like receipts that are used for some sort of warranty.

 The app will be user specific requiring a user login. A user will be able to set reminders for certain based off of time or  
specific date. They will also be able to input an items UPC or model # to make use of Amazon's product API providing
the user with a description, image, price and a link to purchase.  




### Features
(User sign up and Log in): Users will have to create an account before being able to use the app. Then in subsequent use will
have to log in.

(Security): In the form of hashed and salted passwords.

(Input): User can input text, dates and small image files. 

(Links via API): Generated from provided UPC to buy product again.

(Reminders): Alerts on screen when a preset time has elapsed or date has been reached.




### Technologies
React is the framework.

Python

Flask

Javascript/JSX

JQUERY

### What I'll Have to Learn
React is new to me. I am currently learning it, I'll have to learn how to combine it's use with Python
and I haven't used python since unit one so I'm a little rusty.

I would like to host my app on something like firebase to show that  I'm capable of that
and for the ease of showing the app. I think most of my challenge is going to be combining
the different languages into one working application.

My first priority is to get the app functioning on the front end and then working in the backend.
